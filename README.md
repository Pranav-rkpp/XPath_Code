# Introduction

Basic things to write own XPath if website is dynamic.

Already we have given short intro about this topic and its types in previous repo(Selenium_Code). Previous, we have seen scenarios where all the web elements would be retrieved using some extension called selectorsHub and chropath. This will arise a question that whether can we write our own XPath. I will say the answer is yes. This repo only discuss about this content in detail. Because it has various element to learn.
